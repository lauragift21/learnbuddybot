# LearnBuddy Discord Bot

LearnBuddy is a Discord bot designed to facilitate learning within a Discord server. It leverages the power of [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and [Workers AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com/) to provide on-demand, interactive content. At its core, LearnBuddy uses the `@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-fp16` text generation model, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant responses.
